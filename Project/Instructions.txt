Enter a symmetric matrix in the code as input
Non Negative Elements
Property: Columns of the matrix should have sum of probability unity..
The Final Output will be obtained

2) Enter the same Matrix in Pagerank Algorithm
The Steady State output needs to be compared with our output
They will both result into similar Vectors
Since we are condisering an Arbitrary Population in order to get output ,the output of the code might be proportional 
to the Page Rank Output.

The output of code represents the steady state 
The output of Page Rank demonstrates out the Value which needs to be compared in order to rank.
